</div>

<p class='c007'>The history of the Worcester Fire Society is intimately
connected with the history of Worcester, of Massachusetts,
and the United States. Ten of its members have been
Mayors of Worcester, three have been Governors of the
State, three have been Speakers of the House of Representatives,
and many have been Councillors, Senators and Representatives.
Five have been judges of the Supreme Judicial
Court, five have been judges of the Superior Court or Court
of Common Pleas, ten have been Members of Congress, and
many have held office under the United States Government,
and one has been a Foreign Minister.</p>

<p class='c005'>This Fire Society, organized in 1793, was precisely like
one formed by Benjamin Franklin, in the city of Philadelphia,
in 1735:—The number of members limited to thirty,
the same equipments, the same rules and regulations. No
person could be admitted under thirty years of age, and
none over sixty. The Fire Society in Philadelphia was in
existence when this was formed.</p>

<p class='c005'>Governor Lincoln gave his reminiscences of the twenty-two
original members in 1862. Eight years after, in 1870,
a member of this society gave a written account of the next
<span class='pageno' title='3' id='Page_3'>[3]</span><em>fifteen</em> members. Both of these historic papers were published
by this society. Subsequently Judge Thomas, in his
fascinating language, gave a graphic biography of the <em>next</em>
fifteen members, commencing with Governor Lincoln, and
ending with Edward D. Bangs. The object of the present
historic sketch is to give some account of the members from
Edward D. Bangs to the oldest living member, all of whom
have long since passed to the "spirit land." Among them
were distinguished scholars, statesmen, lawyers and physicians,
and five of them were graduates of Dartmouth College.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>SAMUEL JENNISON</h3>

<p class='c009'>Was no ordinary man. He did not enjoy the advantages
of a college education, still he became a learned man and a
very able writer. Some of the choicest articles in periodical
literature were from his pen. He was born in the town of
Brookfield, in 1788, and at the age of twelve years came to
Worcester to reside with his uncle, Hon. Oliver Fiske. In
April, 1810, he was elected accountant in the Worcester
Bank. In August, 1812, he was elected cashier of said Bank,
and continued to hold the office and discharge the duties
with promptness, fidelity and accuracy, for more than thirty-four
years. During much of the time while he was cashier
he was treasurer of the American Antiquarian Society, treasurer
of the State Lunatic Hospital, treasurer of the Worcester
County Institution for Savings, treasurer of the town of
Worcester, and clerk of the town, discharging all the duties
of these offices, much of the time without any assistant. No
<i>irregularities</i> were ever found in his accounts. He was one
of the Council of the American Antiquarian Society, and
<span class='pageno' title='4' id='Page_4'>[4]</span>was a member of many historical and literary societies. He
was admitted a member of this Society in October, 1816,
and remained an active member more than forty years, till
his death, March 11th, 1860.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Jennison was a modest, unassuming man, a gentleman
in his deportment, a man of rare taste and discrimination,
and of wonderful executive talent. He would accomplish
more business in a given time than any man I ever saw; yet
it was done quietly. He was loved and respected by all
who had the pleasure of his acquaintance. He wrote much
in prose and verse; his style was clear and lucid as a mirror.
He gathered much valuable biographical material, part of
which he passed over to the Rev. Dr. Allen just before the
publication of the second edition of his Biographical Dictionary.
The large remainder is now in possession of the
American Antiquarian Society.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>REJOICE NEWTON</h3>

<p class='c009'>Was born in Greenfield, October 18th, 1782. He was
graduated at Dartmouth College, in 1807, and was a classmate
of George Ticknor and Sylvanus Thayer. He commenced
the study of the law with Judge Newcomb, of
Greenfield, and finished his studies in the office of Hon.
Elijah H. Mills, of Northampton, in 1810.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Newton then removed to Worcester, and formed a
co-partnership in law with Hon. Francis Blake, which continued
till April, 1814. He was selected by the citizens of
Worcester, in 1814, to deliver an oration on the fourth of
July. This oration was published, and accelerated his rising
fame. Soon after, he was appointed County Attorney,
<span class='pageno' title='5' id='Page_5'>[5]</span>which office he held for ten years, when he resigned the
position. In 1825 he formed a co-partnership in law with
William Lincoln. His talents and capacity were appreciated
by his fellow citizens, and he was elected to the House of
Representatives in Massachusetts, in the years of 1829, 1830,
and 1831, and a State Senator in 1834. He had great
equanimity of character, and never lost or gained a case
but the result was precisely what he expected. Hence he
was perfectly satisfied with the result of every case. He
was honest, confiding and capable. He became a member
of this society in October, 1816, and remained an active
member for forty-seven years, when his health became poor
and he withdrew. He was long a member and officer in the
American Antiquarian Society. He died in Worcester, February
4th, 1868. Major Newton married a sister of the
late Governor Lincoln, and was a resident in Worcester for
more than half a century. He was honored with important
and responsible positions in the military, legislative, and
executive departments of the government of the State; all
the duties pertaining to these offices he discharged with
ability and fidelity, and to the entire satisfaction of his
constituents.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>SAMUEL M. BURNSIDE.</h3>

<p class='c009'>His ancestors were Scots. He was a son of Thomas
Burnside, and was born in Northumberland, New Hampshire,
July 18th, 1783. His education was at the common
schools in New Hampshire, except nine months at an
academy, preparatory to his entering Dartmouth College.</p>

<p class='c005'>After he was graduated from college, in 1805, he took
<span class='pageno' title='6' id='Page_6'>[6]</span>charge of a Female Academy in Andover, Mass., for two
years. He read law with Hon. Artemas Ward, so long
Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas. He was
admitted to practice in 1810, commenced the practice of the
law in the Spring of 1810, in the town of Westborough, in
this County, and removed to Worcester in the autumn of
the same year. He married the daughter of Judge Foster
of Brookfield.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Burnside was a well read lawyer, and it is no disparagement
to any lawyer of the Worcester Bar to say that
none excelled him in his extensive knowledge of the law.
He was also well posted in theology, and took a deep interest
in our public schools. He was trustee in Leicester
Academy, and for many years was a member of the School
Committee of Worcester, a member of the American Antiquarian
Society, and one of the Council of said Society at
the time of his death. He delivered an able address before
the schools of Worcester in 1826, and represented the town
in the Legislature the same year. In 1831 he was selected
by the citizens of Worcester to deliver an oration on the
fourth of July, which was considered a very able production.
He was admitted to this society in January, 1817,
and remained an active member for thirty-three years. He
died in Worcester, July 25th, 1850, much respected by a
large circle of friends.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Burnside was a good classical scholar, an upright and
honored citizen, and a kind christian gentleman.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>REUBEN WHEELER</h3>

<p class='c009'>Was a member of this society from 1817 to 1822. He
came from Rutland, where he was born, to Worcester, to
<span class='pageno' title='7' id='Page_7'>[7]</span>execute the purposes of certain members of the Fire Society,
who had become convinced that the business of <em>tanning</em> was
very profitable. They raised thirty thousand dollars to put
into the business—Mr. Wheeler was superintendent and
manager—a large yard was built on Market street, the
largest in the county—Mr. Wheeler built a spacious house
on the corner of Main and Thomas streets, and business
went on swimmingly for five or six years, Mr. Wheeler
always assuring the proprietors that the business was very
profitable. Some of the proprietors having had no dividends
for several years, succeeded in raising a committee to investigate
the affairs of the company, when it turned out that the
concern was bankrupt. It was a South Sea bubble on a
small scale. Wheeler left town, and the tannery rotted
down. "<em>Sic transit gloria mundi.</em>"</p>

<h3 class='c008'>BENJAMIN F. HEYWOOD</h3>

<p class='c009'>Was the son of Hon. Benjamin Heywood, of Worcester,
who was judge of the Court of Common Pleas for nine years.</p>

<p class='c005'>Benjamin F. was born in Worcester, April 24th, 1792,
and graduated at Dartmouth College, in the class of 1812.
He attended the medical lectures at Dartmouth College, and
at Yale College, and took his degree of M. D. at Yale, in
1815. He formed a co-partnership with Dr. John Green, in
the practice of medicine, which existed for twenty years.
Dr. Heywood was councillor and censor in the Massachusetts
Medical Society, and became a member of the Society of
Cincinnati in 1859, in the right of his father, who was an
original member. As a physician he was very popular
among his patients. He had the confidence of his fellow
<span class='pageno' title='8' id='Page_8'>[8]</span>citizens, being repeatedly elected to both branches of the
City Government. His manners were pleasant and agreeable—a
man of good judgment and sound discretion. He
was admitted a member of this society July, 1817, and
remained an active member for more than fifty-two years,
till his death, December 7th, 1869.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dr. Heywood married for his first wife, and also for his
second wife, sisters of Dr. John Green. He was a skillful
physician, a good citizen, honorable in his dealings; a man
of few words, kind and courteous, honored and respected by
those who had the pleasure of his acquaintance.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>ABIJAH BIGELOW</h3>

<p class='c009'>Was born in Westminster, county of Worcester, Dec. 5th,
1775. He was graduated at Dartmouth College, in the
class of 1795, studied law, and was admitted to practice in
1798, and opened an office in the town of Leominster, served
the town as town clerk for five consecutive years, was twice
elected by his fellow citizens a member of the General
Court of Massachusetts, and was elected a member of Congress
in 1810, and held the position till 1815.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Bigelow removed to Worcester in 1817, was elected a
member of the American Antiquarian Society, and a trustee
of Leicester Academy. From 1817 to 1833 he held the
office of Clerk of the Courts in the County of Worcester.</p>

<p class='c005'>In 1838 he was appointed Master in Chancery for the
county of Worcester. He held the office of Justice of the
Peace for about fifty years. He was admitted to this society
about a year after he was appointed Clerk of the Courts, to
wit, in 1818, and continued a member till 1848, when he
<span class='pageno' title='9' id='Page_9'>[9]</span>withdrew from the society. In the evening of his life he
devoted much of his time to horticulture, agriculture, literature
and poetry. Some of his choice poetical productions
are in print. He died in Worcester, April 5th, 1860, at the
ripe old age of eighty five years, and is well remembered by
most of the living members of this society.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>JOHN MOWER</h3>

<p class='c009'>Was a son of Ebenezer Mower of Worcester; he received
his education at the common schools and at Leicester Academy.
He entered the mercantile business, and opened a store
on the corner of Main and Thomas streets. He married
Dolly Chamberlain, a daughter of William Chamberlain.
He was a bright, intelligent and well educated young man;
was popular with the young men of the place, and especially
with the young lawyers.</p>

<p class='c005'>Soon after he was twenty-one years of age, high sheriff
Ward appointed him deputy sheriff for the county, and for
years, by the prompt and able manner in which he discharged
his duties, he did a larger business than any other
officer in the county. He was a member of this society less
than a year, when he emigrated to the South, and died at
Fort Gibson, Mississippi, April 15th, 1828.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>SAMUEL WARD</h3>

<p class='c009'>Was born in Guilford, Vermont, June 9th, 1793. He
was educated by his uncle, Capt. Ward, of Lancaster; came
to this place when a young man, and married into one of the
oldest and most respectable families of Worcester.</p>

<p class='c005'>He was admitted to this society in 1819, and remained an
<span class='pageno' title='10' id='Page_10'>[10]</span>active member for eleven years. In the military department
of the government he was deeply interested. At this time
every able-bodied citizen, between the ages of eighteen and
forty-five years, was obliged to perform military duty at least
five days in each year. Worcester, then with a population
of little more than three thousand, had full and well disciplined
companies of artillery, cavalry, riflemen, and two
very large companies of infantry. Mr. Ward took great
pleasure in military affairs, and was ambitious to excel and
become a good disciplinarian; and he succeeded remarkably
well. He was promoted from one position to another, till
he was finally elected Colonel of the Sixth Regiment.</p>

<p class='c005'>The next morning after he was promoted from Major to
the office of Colonel, he was walking down Main street, in
his most dignified manner, very straight—a little more than
perpendicular, when Israel Whitney, who wanted to see
him on business, called out, "Major Ward!" Ward walked
on. Whitney called a second time, louder, "Major Ward!"
No attention was paid to the call. He called a third time,
"<em>Colonel Ward!</em>" Ward turns immediately and walks
towards Whitney, and says, "Good morning, Mr. Whitney.
I am glad to see you. <em>I did not hear you the first two
times you called!</em>"</p>

<p class='c005'>Colonel Ward was a gentleman in his manners, intelligent,
kind and courteous; prompt, energetic and faithful in the
discharge of his duties, and agreeable and entertaining in
conversation. He died in Boston, March 1st, 1842.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>SAMUEL HATHAWAY</h3>

<p class='c009'>Came to Worcester in the early part of this century, from
the town of Taunton, in this State. He became the owner
<span class='pageno' title='11' id='Page_11'>[11]</span>of the Central Hotel, on Main street, standing where the
Bay State House now stands. At that time there was a
large farm connected with the hotel, and Mr. Hathaway
carried on the farm and kept the hotel. He was admitted
to this society in 1819, and remained an active member as
long as he lived.</p>

<p class='c005'>The society frequently held its meetings at his hotel,
where the members were always sure of having good fare.</p>

<p class='c005'>About 1823 Samuel Hathaway sold out his estate on Main
street, purchased a farm at Washington Square, and built a
hotel. His farm included all the land occupied by the
Boston &amp; Albany Railroad, and on both sides of Grafton
street. He became a wealthy man, and built for himself a
house on Front street, retired from business, and died in
Worcester, March 16th, 1831, much respected by his fellow
citizens. Mr. Hathaway was a man of good common sense,
fond of wit and anecdote, very pleasant and agreeable in
conversation, and was willing to give and take a joke in a
pleasant and agreeable manner.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>WILLIAM EATON</h3>

<p class='c009'>Was a lineal descendant from the first settlers of Worcester.
His influence with his fellow citizens was seldom
surpassed. For twelve years, from 1810 to 1830, he was
elected one of the selectmen of the town of Worcester.
For ten years he represented the town in the Legislature
of Massachusetts. He held office under the United
States Government in the war of 1812. For many
years he was one of the County Commissioners for
the county of Worcester, and for many years a deputy
<span class='pageno' title='12' id='Page_12'>[12]</span>sheriff within and for said county. All the duties of these
various offices he discharged with kindness and ability. He
was a man of strict integrity, upright and honorable in all
business transactions, and commanded the respect and esteem
of all who had the pleasure of his acquaintance. He
was a member of this society for thirty-three years. He died
in Worcester, May 4th, 1859, at the age of ninety-three.
His daughter now owns and occupies the estate on the
west side of Main street, where Mr. Eaton resided most of
his lifetime.</p>

<p class='c005'>Very few men have lived in Worcester who understood
the workings of the human mind among the masses better
than William Eaton. Hence he never was at loss to know
how to approach a man and control him under any circumstances.
His gentle and kind manner enabled him to exert
a powerful influence over his fellow citizens. This was
the secret of his great power among the people.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>GEORGE A. TRUMBULL</h3>

<p class='c009'>Was born in Petersham, in 1793. He removed to Worcester
and opened a book store on the site on the west side
of Main street where the house of Harrison Bliss now
stands. His agreeable manners attracted customers to his
store, and he had a lucrative business for ten years, till he
sold out his stock and store to Clarendon Harris.</p>

<p class='c005'>He was elected cashier of the Central Bank in 1829, and
held the office till 1836, when he resigned, and was chosen
cashier of the Citizens Bank. He held this office for
eighteen years, when he resigned, and his son-in-law was
elected in his place. Mr. Trumbull wrote a beautiful hand,
<span class='pageno' title='13' id='Page_13'>[13]</span>was a good accountant (never any irregularities in his
accounts), strictly honest, easy and agreeable in his manners,
a gentleman in his deportment, modest and retiring, always
declining any public office offered him by his fellow citizens,
and always had about him a large circle of warm friends.
He was a member of this society for eleven years. Few
men have lived in Worcester more respected than George A.
Trumbull. He was the father of a large family, and moved
in the first society in Worcester, lived in a house situated on
what is now called Trumbull Square, and now occupied by
Mrs. Trumbull, which was occupied by his father before he
came into possession of it.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>JOHN W. HUBBARD</h3>

<p class='c009'>Was a relative of Rev. Samuel Austin, D.D., so long the
pastor of the Old South Church. Dr. Austin adopted him
and gave him his education. In 1811, at the age of seventeen
years, he was selected by the Federal Party to deliver
a fourth of July oration at Worcester, which was printed.
His production was well received and gave him character for
talent and ability. He was born in Brookfield, Vermont,
in 1794, and graduated at Dartmouth College, in 1814, in
the same class with the famous Thaddeus Stevens and Governor
Dinsmore; studied law with Governor Van Ness, of
Vermont and Samuel M. Burnside, of Worcester, was admitted
to the Bar in Worcester County in 1817, and practiced
law in Worcester till his death, September 19th, 1825.
Mr. Hubbard possessed a well cultivated mind, clear and discriminating,
and had an extensive practice. He formed a
co-partnership in law with the late Judge Kinnicutt, but
<span class='pageno' title='14' id='Page_14'>[14]</span>lived only a few weeks after the co-partnership was formed.
He was a member of this society only four years. Mr.
Hubbard owned and occupied an estate on Main street,
including some ten or fifteen acres of land on each side of
Austin street. He was a gentleman in his manners, upright
and honest in business transactions, energetic and persevering
in his profession; an able and well read lawyer.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>OTIS CORBETT</h3>

<p class='c009'>Was a native of Milford, came to Worcester in the early
part of this century, and opened a jewelry store on the west
side of Main street, opposite Mechanics Hall, where he
acquired a very snug property in his business. He was
much respected by his fellow citizens, and was elected a
representative to the General Court from Worcester in the
years 1824, '26, '27, '28, '30 and '31. He was also chosen
one of the selectmen of Worcester in the years 1825, '26
and '29. In May, 1829, he was chosen cashier of the Central
Bank, and resigned the office in the autumn of the same
year. Mr. Corbett remained an active member of this
society for twenty-seven years. He was a man of stern
integrity, strictly honest, and commanded the confidence of
all who knew him intimately. For many years he was one
of the trustees of the Worcester Academy, and took a deep
interest in the public schools of Worcester, and was for
many years a member of the School Board.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Corbett owned and occupied a house on Front street,
where the meeting house of Dr. Cutler now stands, for
twenty years. He then became the owner of the house on
High street, where Deacon Upham now lives. Here he
<span class='pageno' title='15' id='Page_15'>[15]</span>lived until his death, February 6th, 1868. Mr. Corbett received
his education in the common schools, still he was
better educated than many who had received a collegiate
education. A man of sound judgment, discreet and honest,
kind and courteous, and a wise counsellor.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>CHARLES WHEELER</h3>

<p class='c009'>Was a son of Theophilus Wheeler, so long Register of
Probate for the county of Worcester. He was born in
Worcester, August 10th, 1793; was educated a merchant
and kept a store for many years, on the east side of Main
street, in the modern building next north of the Wheeler
mansion. He was somewhat eccentric in his character, had
no fondness whatever for womankind, and always lived a
bachelor. He was very modest in his deportment, and
strictly honest in all his dealings. He was admitted a
member of this society July, 1823, and withdrew from it in
April, 1826, and died in Worcester, March 6th, 1827.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>SAMUEL B. THOMAS,</h3>

<p class='c009'>While he resided in Worcester, was a portly, polite and
pleasant landlord. He succeeded Col. Reuben Sikes, one of
the founders of the first line of stages from Boston to New
York, as the proprietor of the public house on Main street,
now called the Exchange Hotel. It may not be inappropriate
to mention here, that all the fuel that Capt. Thomas
used for heating his hotel for years, was Worcester anthracite
coal, procured at two dollars a ton. This coal was
found in the northeasterly part of the city, where there is an
abundance, when the enterprise of citizens shall develop it.
<span class='pageno' title='16' id='Page_16'>[16]</span>He was admitted to this society in October, 1824, and
after his admission the society held its quarterly meetings at
his hotel. The fare was crackers and cheese, ham, or tongue,
and wine, and each member paid twenty-five cents for his
entertainment. At the annual meetings a sumptuous supper
was provided, with wines and liquors, and the charge was
one dollar for each member.</p>

<p class='c005'>Of course Capt. Thomas was a popular member, and
remained an active member for sixteen years, until his death.</p>

<p class='c005'>He was born in Brookfield in 1779, and died in Worcester,
April 24th, 1840. Capt. Thomas was pleasant and agreeable
in his manners, popular with his fellow citizens, and
was chosen a representative to the General Court, from
Worcester, in 1834, and had many warm admirers.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Gentlemen of the Society</i>:</p>

<p class='c005'>In obedience to a request of your Committee on Publication,
I have hastily drawn up these historic sketches of the
fifteen members of the Society next preceding the oldest
living member. If I have been so fortunate in my sketches
as to meet the approval of the members of the society, I
shall feel myself amply compensated for the labor of gathering
facts from history, and from the records of towns and
counties, and taxing the recollections of our venerable citizens,
in order to accomplish the object requested of me by
the Committee.</p>

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost

  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site

to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary

<h3 class="pg">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
